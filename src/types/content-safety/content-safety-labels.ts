 *
 * Simply include the `content_safety` parameter in your `POST` request when submitting audio files for transcription, and set this parameter to `true`.
 *
 * ## Interpreting Content Safety Detection Results
 *
 * Once the transcription is complete, and you [get the result](/walkthroughs#getting-the-transcription-result "null"), there will be an additional key `content_safety_labels` in the JSON response. Below, we'll drill into the data that is returned in the `content_safety_labels` key.
 *
 * ## Understanding Severity Scores and Confidence Scores
 *
 * Each label will be returned with a `confidence` score and a `severity` score. It is important to note that these two keys measure two very different things. The `severity` key will produce a score that shows how severe the flagged content is on a scale of `0â€“1`. For example, a natural disaster with mass casualties would be a `1`, whereas a wind storm that broke a lamppost would be a `0.1`.
 *
 * In comparison, `confidence` displays how confident the model was in predicting the label it predicted, also on a scale of `0-1`.
 *
 * We can break this down further by reviewing the following label:
 * ```
 *     "labels": [
 *         {
 *             "label": "health_issues",
 *             "confidence": 0.8225132822990417,
 *             "severity": 0.15090347826480865
 *         }
 *     ],
 * ```
 * In the above example, the Content Safety model is indicating it is `82.25%` confident that the spoken content is about Health Issues; however, it is measured at a low severity of `0.1509`. This means the model is very confident the content is about health issues, but the content was not severe in nature (ie, was likely about a minor health issue).
 *
 * ## Understanding the Severity Score Summary
 *
 * The `severity_score_summary` key lists each label that was detected along with `low`, `medium`, and `high` keys.
 * ```
 *     "severity_score_summary": {
 *         "health_issues": {
 *             "low": 0.7210625030587972,
 *             "medium": 0.2789374969412028,
 *             "high": 0.0
 *         }
 *     }
 * ```
 *
 * The value of the `low`, `medium`, and `high` keys reflect the API's confidence that the label is "low," "medium," or "high" in severity throughout the entire audio file. This score is based on the intersection of the length of the audio file, the frequency of `low`/`medium`/`high` severity tags through the file, and the `confidence` score for each of those occurrences.
 *
 * ## Controlling the Threshold of Surfaced Results
 *
 * By default, the content safety model will return any label with a confidence of 50% or greater. If you wish to set a higher or lower threshold, simply add the `content_safety_confidence: {number}` parameter to your `POST` request. This parameter will accept an integer value between `25` and `100`, inclusive.

  results?: ContentSafetyResult[];
  /**
   * For each label that was predicted in the `results` set, the `summary` key provides the confidence of each label in relation to the entire audio file. For example, there could be a single result of `disasters` with `0.99` confidence, but if this was a single result in a 3 hour audio file, the `summary` would show a low confidence for `disasters` - indicating that `disasters` is not spoken of widely throughout the entire audio file.
