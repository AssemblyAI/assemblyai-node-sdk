/**
 * # Entity Detection
 *
 * With Entity Detection, you can identify a wide range of entities that are spoken in your audio files,
 * such as person and company names, email addresses, dates, and locations.
 *
 * To include Entity Detection in your transcript response, add the entity_detection parameter in your
 * POST request when submitting audio files for transcription, and set this parameter to true.
 *
 * When your transcription is complete, you will see an entities key in the JSON response, as shown on
 * the right. Below, we drill into the data that is returned within the list of results in the entities key.
 *
 * ## Entity Types Detected
 *
 * When Entity Detection is enabled, the entity types listed below are automatically detected and, if found
 * in the transcription text, will be included in the entities key as shown above.
 * They will be listed individually in the order that they appear in the transcript.
